\section{CinCPaper}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Extraction of RIIV from 10 Subjects: 
\item I got the names of the channels-> Hence you are able to continue. 
\item Extraction of HR from 10 Subject
\item Bland and Altman Analysis for the top items. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Directed Study 2016 Spring}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Writing DD report to Bozena
\item Writing CinC paper 
\item Proposing the DD II, or get a semester off for summer
\item BackEnd server for iOS app
\item PPG sensor: I managed to convine that a new sensor is going to be valuable. Then she asked to have the control over IP, by desining it within her people. No problem for me, this is the line, if I want something I will do it. I dont have a lot of time to design it myself, and I dont want to spend my years in optic dessing. I will try to from the idea in a peace of the paper. 
\item Read Light intensity via Camera then process the changes in OpenCV OMG, lots of appplications, then I can read the 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{ActionItems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item PPG sensor: I will have to study the algorithm and the architecture. I can propose a architecture for the sensor, and demand it to build myself or someone else, if I can use him to get to my goal faster which is an operational PPG sensor end to end system. Plasmic based sensors.  is the keyword. 
\item I have to focus: 
\item What is going to be next DD, Please document it. 
\item Dependency for MSER: 
\item Reading the PPG from camera
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22753165/detecting-if-iphone-is-in-a-dark-room/
\item OpenCV Peak Detection
\item Finding items with OpenCV
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11424002/how-to-detect-simple-geometric-shapes-using-opencv
\item Obtaining Luminosity from an iOS Camera: http://b2cloud.com.au/tutorial/obtaining-luminosity-from-an-ios-camera/
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{iOS App}
Kian, I have to figure out the MSER. End of the story. 
Problem is how can I build and image template. Next, how can I view the results.
Once it is observed, then use the teplate on an image.
You can have access to heart rate data with a spesific intervals: \hyperlink{https://www.raywenderlich.com/117433/accessing-heart-rate-data-researchkit-study}{https://www.raywenderlich.com/117433/accessing-heart-rate-data-researchkit-study}
[KD April1st 14:43] ok i can load an image to the controller and the bus repo. can play with those, next. can you extract MSER features from it?

\subsection{Joining Kouhyar's Team}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transcript from SFU  Non a problem on March 30th 2016 I will do it. 
\item Bachelor Transcripts ( Due on Raj at school SFU -  Friday April 1st) 
\item TOEFL (Friday April 1st)
\item THe problem is that I own 1500 to SFU, rediculous money, with this money, I can easily buy six months of the Freedmen on Whistler. I will do it at all costs. I will Ask Raj tomorrow to send the transcript (I will print it, and then ask her to send the whole pachage)

\section{Sage}
Problem with the messaging: The response coming back from the internal controller checked in the javascript. The jsonresult. UserMessage is null!! Why? 





\subsection{Credit Card}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show Up messages: It seems that the the message does executes but does not have time to show up. Maybe some sort of service routine call
\end{enumerate}

\section{MS-DS-FaceBook-Google}
This summer I have to focus and train myself. 

\section{MD}
By 2020 in the Med School
